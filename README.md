Our webapp is recipe website which you can search any recipes by ingredients.

The webapp is using Spooncular API to fetch already existing recipes instead of using database to store and register recipes by anonymous people. 

This API allows you to find by ingredients and also wine pairing for specific foods (such as cheddar)
On the top page, it shows the random top-ranking recipes which attracts people to find more.

## API
![71RdAdg3TkL _US230_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55519118/71813722-bf9e5b80-30bd-11ea-8d66-cf0d2c026820.jpg)

We used [spooncularAPI](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to fetch recipe data.
The reason behind we chose this API is because we still couldn't build DB and we didn't have enough time to put enough data into it.

This API allows you to fetch any recipes by ingredients and sory by ranking or more. 
(though we didn't have enought time to specify these options sadly...)
